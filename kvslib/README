KVSlib

C library for key-value storage. The library provides an API to create and use dynamic associative arrays for
arbitrary data. Data may be stored and retrieved by copy or by reference. Stored data is reference counted to
prevent dangling pointers. Optimised for fast lookups and large data sets. Requires C99, no dependencies,
platform independent. BSD style license.
